When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I`m working from different computers, or if I`m interested
in someone`s project, and proposing some feature to them to add.

Or if some minor changes need to be done, and I have no working machine close to me,
it would be ok to use remote, and check everything later.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Probably, it is not a good idea to push files to the GitHub, when you have your
feature uncomplited or not working yet, so you`d like to work it through untill sharing.

After sharing, some people or collegues pobably will insert some changes and add files.
It will possible break your logic of acting, or even will cause program`s crash. So, automtic
back-up is not logical, because you need to check this files first.
