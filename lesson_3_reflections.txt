When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I`m working from different computers, or if I`m interested
in someone`s project, and proposing some feature to them to add.

Or if some minor changes need to be done, and I have no working machine close to me,
it would be ok to use remote, and check everything later.
