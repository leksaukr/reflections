To creatr a git repository in already existing folder
use ------git init--------- then, if you`ll use |ls -a|
it will show .git folder inside it, means that this is
already a git repository.

git status is to get info about commit you are now in, and
also about all changings which happened in this commit.

The folder .git folder is added to the parental directory. This folder
contains all metadata that makes possible to user get more old commits.
To do this simply use ||||| git init |||||
