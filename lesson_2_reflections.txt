To create a git repository in already existing folder
use ------git init--------- then, if you`ll use |ls -a|
it will show .git folder inside it, means that this is
already a git repository.

git status is to get info about commit you are now in, and
also about all changings which happened in this commit.


What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The folder .git folder is added to the parental directory. This folder
contains all metadata that makes possible to user get more old commits.
To do this simply use ||||| git init |||||


To add file to the staging area - git add
To remove it from there - git remove

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory consists off all files, that are in the repository,
but if you`d like to change and commit not all of them, you need to add
them to the staging area. It plays a buffer`s role, before files
would be committed.

If you want to compare original files and the ones in the staging area -
use ||| git diff ||| without any arguments.
